"""
The main thing this library does is when given an item, figure out the 
raw materials and tools / equipment needed to make it.   
This works recursively.

This is effectively an intermediary between the OpenAI API (which is quite
general).  This library contains a bunch of the From Caves To Cars specific 
functionality, while allowing the other library to be more general.

Right now this library focuses on building things from what would be found
in nature by breaking this process down into two parts:

1) Raw Materials: Basic substances needed for production (e.g., wood, metal, fabric).

2) Tools / Equipment: Instruments required to manipulate raw materials (e.g., saws, hammers, machines).

In the future, I may expand this to include the other 3 items (Energy Sources,
Knowledge and Skills, and Time) but for now, I'm just going to focus on
the first two.

My first idea, just get a list of all of these things.   If there is an "OR" or
an optional item, handle these in the simplest way possible.   This means
pick the first item of any OR and drop all optional items.

TODO: Expand on this later to enable different items to be used.
